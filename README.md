- Data Analysis: User can assign a 'tag' to each task and assess the productivity of each task upon completion, the data from which is then used to create bar charts to detect changes in productivity over a week and see which types of tasks were more dominant, allowing for patterns to be spotted on a longer scale process surrounding a user's productivity.
- Weekly Goals: Section allowing the user to create weekly goals, with an optional time limit, so that they can track how much time has been spent towards a given task and ensure they keep on track with the goals they have set.
